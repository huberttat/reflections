How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    yes. this save me a lot of time. so i dont have to go over everything line by line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    so that i can go back to perious verion to understand how did i create those code or rewind my code to perious verision or see is there any other way to pervent the bug happening at the first place.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    help me understand what did i change in different version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    so that i can create differnt versiono of the code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    so that i can go back to differen vesion see what is the error i had made in perperos version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    so now. i dont have to worry breaking things. i just make all kind of changes.even if i break things. i can alway go back to perious verision

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    dont know . i think just try to use it. bcoz i am sure it will be useful in future somehow
