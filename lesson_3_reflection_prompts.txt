When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your worklocal?

    when more then one people is working the project. Also remote repository is a really great way to use it as a great back up system. espically when the server or the pc is need maintenance.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Gitautomatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    i am not really sure. In my opinion stay up-to-dat is a much better to store backup. 
    but if that are muiltply people working in the same programme. auto commit will casue a mess.
